# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a personal portfolio repository ("this-is-me") that serves as a container for various projects and learning materials. The repository is organized into project subdirectories under the `projects/` folder.

## Repository Structure

```
this-is-me/
├── projects/                          # Main projects directory
│   └── techworld-with-nana-bootcamps/ # Learning materials from TechWorld with Nana bootcamps
│       └── devops/                    # DevOps bootcamp materials
└── README.md                          # Repository introduction
```

## Project Organization

This repository follows a modular structure where each major project or learning track lives in its own subdirectory under `projects/`. Currently includes:

- **techworld-with-nana-bootcamps/devops**: Materials, exercises, and projects from TechWorld with Nana's DevOps bootcamp

As new projects or bootcamp materials are added, they should follow the same pattern: `projects/<project-name>/` or `projects/<bootcamp-series>/<specific-course>/`
- Do not use git commands. Just give a meaningful git commit message when your work is done in the conventional commits structure.
